    <a name="about"/><br>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I graduated from the University of Toledo in 2007 with a degree in Marketing. I found the business world a little too stuff and instead found my passion in teaching. Jobs in Florida were plentiful so I migrated south and spent the next 7 years living on the edge of the Everglades in Naples, Florida. By day I taught math, reading and technology to grades 6-8. By nights and weekends I explored the local flora and fauna, discovering amazing beaches, nightlife that wraps up around 8p.m., and of course, exotic creatures like the “snowbird.”</p><br>

    <p>In early 2015, I became very interested in the movement toward teaching programming in school alongside core subjects. If I were going to be able to be a part of this movement it was clear that I needed to learn learn to code myself. I attended Wyncode Academy in Ft. Lauderdale in summer of 2015 as a way to gain the skills quickly and effectively. I hope to gain employment as a full stack developer and continue to be involved in teaching students in communities across the US and around the world how to code. Reaching students
    and giving them the necessary skills at a young age will be crucial to meeting our technology needs going forward. I’m thrilled to be a part of such an exiting time in our nation’s educational movement.</p><br>

    <p>On a more personal note, I am originally from Columbus, Ohio and thus I will always bleed scarlet and gray. Although football is my favorite sport, I enjoy watching many others including tennis, golf and soccer. Reading, beaching, and visiting local restaurants are my favored downtime activities.</p><br>

    <p>Other than football and teaching my third passion is travel. I have lived in Spain and backpacked through several countries in Europe and Central America with friends and solo. I am happiest when traveling and hope to someday spend time teaching students in other countries while I travel. I also own a small travel trailer which I contemplate “full-timing” in someday. I am inspired by the tiny house movement, sustainable living, and the freedom of moving wherever life and work takes me.</p><br>
